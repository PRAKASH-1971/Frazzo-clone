Start and Difficulties-

We don’t know each other before so, first each of us have been introduced, we decided to analyze the project, gathered the required tools and techniques to accomplish the task and knowing the ability of each team member. On second day we divided the entire project in the equal amount among all the team members, we also lost some of our files when we try to push on GitHub .Somehow we solved all issues and at last we managed to complete the project before the deadline.

How we made this possible?

Now the biggest question arrive how we made this project just in 7days.so I can say that it all possible with Team Building.
